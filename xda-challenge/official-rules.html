GOVERNING LAW AND DISPUTE RESOLUTION.</h5><p>These Official Rules shall be construed and interpreted in accordance with federal laws and the laws of the State of California without giving effect to California’s conflicts of laws principles thereof. Any dispute under these Official Rules shall be submitted to binding arbitration. Such arbitration shall be conducted by International Court of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce (“ICC”). There shall be one (1) arbitrator agreed upon by the parties, and if the parties cannot agree within ten (10) days, then ICC shall make the appointment. The arbitrator shall be a trial attorney having not less than fifteen (15) years’ experience in intellectual property matters and sales and licensing of technology. The arbitration shall be conducted in the English language. The place of arbitration shall be Palo Alto, California. In addition to the authority conferred on the arbitrator by the ICC Rules, the arbitrator shall order the production of relevant documents requested by either party. At the request of any party, the arbitrator shall order the deposition of any witness who submits a witness statement. The arbitrator shall have the discretion to hear and determine at any stage of the arbitration any issue asserted by any party to be dispositive of any claim or counter-claim, in whole or part, in accordance with such procedure as the arbitrator may deem appropriate, and the arbitrator may render an award on such issue. The parties undertake to keep confidential all awards in their arbitration, together with all materials in the proceedings created for the purpose of the arbitration and all other documents produced by another party in the proceedings not otherwise in the public domain, save and to the extent that disclosure may be required of a party by legal duty, to protect or pursue a legal right or to enforce or challenge an award in legal proceedings before a court or other judicial authority. The arbitrator may award to the prevailing party, if any, as determined by the arbitrator, its costs and expenses including attorneys’ fees. The arbitral award shall be final and binding upon the parties hereto. Any monetary award shall be made payable in United States Dollars. Judgment on the award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.
