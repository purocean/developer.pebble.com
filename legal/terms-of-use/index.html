respects the intellectual property rights of others, and we ask you to do the
same. Pebble may, in appropriate circumstances and at our discretion, terminate
service and/or access to the Site(s) for users who infringe the intellectual
property rights of others. If you believe that your work is the subject of

<ul>
<li>A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf

,&quot; &quot; <strong>we,</strong>&quot; &quot; <strong>us,</strong>&quot; and &quot; <strong>our</strong>&quot; refer to <strong>Pebble Technology Corp</strong>.,
including its subsidiaries and agents; the terms &quot; <strong>you</strong>&quot; and &quot; <strong>your</strong>&quot;
refer to you as an individual as well as other individuals you allow to access
or use the Products, and any legal entity you control, work for, or represent
when you access or use the Products. The word &quot; <strong>Products</strong>&quot; means your access
to and/or use of any Pebble website, advertisement or promotion and any product,
service, or software that you obtain from or through Pebble. The word &quot;
<strong>Claims</strong>&quot; means all claims, disputes, or controversies between you and us of
any nature or kind, whether pre-existing, present, or future, that arise from or
relate to the Products. This includes but is not limited to disagreements about
the validity, enforceability, or scope of this Arbitration Provision.</p><p><strong>Informal Efforts to Resolve Dispute.</strong> If a dispute arises between you and
Pebble, you should first attempt to resolve it by sending an email to
<a href="mailto:legal@getpebble.com" title="" class="">legal@getpebble.com</a> or by sending the details of
your complaint, including your contact information for a response, to the
address or fax number listed below. We will attempt in good faith to resolve all
Claims submitted this way within fifteen (15) days of receipt.</p><p><strong>Agreement to Arbitrate; Right to Opt Out.</strong> If informal efforts to resolve
Claims fail or are not used, you agree that any and all Claims will be resolved
exclusively by binding arbitration as described herein, except that: (i)you may
assert Claims in a small claims court in the United States if your Claims meet
the court&#39;s jurisdictional requirements; and (ii) either party may pursue Claims
and relief in a court of competent jurisdiction regarding the validity and/or
infringement of a party&#39;s intellectual property rights.</p><p>There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration
award is very limited. However, an arbitrator can award to you on an individual
basis the same damages and forms of relief as a court could (including
injunctive and declaratory relief as well as statutory damages), and must follow
the law and terms of this Agreement as a court would. Any arbitration under this
Agreement will take place on an individual basis; class arbitrations and class
actions and private attorney general actions are not permitted.</p><p><strong>IF YOU DO NOT WISH TO BE BOUND BY THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION, YOU MUST NOTIFY
PEBBLE IN WRITING WITHIN 30 DAYS FROM THE DATE THAT YOU FIRST ACCEPT OR HAVE
ACCESS TO THIS AGREEMENT BY MAILING OR FAXING AN OPT-OUT REQUEST TO OUR CUSTOMER
SERVICE CENTER LISTED BELOW. YOUR WRITTEN NOTIFICATION MUST INCLUDE YOUR NAME,
ADDRESS, THE EMAIL ADDRESS YOU USED TO REGISTER WITH PEBBLE, AND A CLEAR
STATEMENT THAT YOU DO NOT WISH TO RESOLVE DISPUTES WITH US THROUGH ARBITRATION.
YOUR DECISION TO OPT OUT OF THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION WILL HAVE NO ADVERSE
EFFECT ON YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH US OR THE DELIVERY OF PRODUCTS TO YOU BY US. IF
YOU HAVE PREVIOUSLY NOTIFIED US OF YOUR DECISION TO OPT OUT OF ARBITRATION, YOU
DO NOT NEED TO DO SO AGAIN.</strong></p><p><strong>Arbitration Fees</strong>. The allocation and payment of all filing, administration
and arbitrator fees will be governed by the JAMS&#39;s rules which limit the amount
a consumer is required to pay. If the arbitrator determines that your Claims are
not frivolous applying the standards of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, we
agree to reimburse you the amount of all filing, administration and arbitrator
fees you are required to pay for the arbitration.</p><p><strong>Arbitration Rules</strong>. The arbitration will be conducted by the JAMS (&quot;JAMS&quot;)
under its rules if you are a resident of the United States; if your use of the
Products has been principally for personal or household use, the JAMS&#39;
procedures for consumer-related disputes including the minimum fairness
standards will also apply. If you are a resident of a country other than the
United States, the arbitration will be conducted by the JAMS in San Francisco,
California, under its rules for international arbitration, and you and we agree
to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the U.S. federal court in San
Francisco, California in order to compel arbitration, to stay proceedings
pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the
award entered by the arbitrator. In the event of a conflict or inconsistency
between the applicable arbitration rules and this Arbitration Provision, this
Arbitration Provision shall govern and control.</p><p>The arbitration will be conducted in the English language by a single arbitrator
who is an attorney-at-law with at least fifteen years&#39; experience in consumer
and technology transactions and who is also a member of the JAMS roster of
arbitrators. If you and we can&#39;t agree on a mutually acceptable arbitrator
within fifteen (15) days after the arbitration is initiated, then the JAMS will
pick a neutral arbitrator who meets the qualifications. The JAMS rules are
available at <a href="http://www.jamsadr.com" title="" class="">http://www.jamsadr.com</a>, or by calling 1-
800 – 352- 5267 from inside the United States or +44 207 583 9808 from outside
the United States.</p><p><strong>Initiating Arbitration</strong>. To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must follow
the procedures specified by the applicable JAMS rules as described on their
website at <a href="http://www.jamsadr.com" title="" class="">http://www.jamsadr.com</a>.</p><p><strong>Time Restriction.</strong> YOU MUST FILE A COMPLAINT WITH JAMS OR A PERMITTED COURT
WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR OF THE DATE OF THE OCCURRENCE OF THE EVENT OR FACTS GIVING
RISE TO A CLAIM, OR YOU WAIVE THE RIGHT TO PURSUE ANY CLAIM BASED UPON SUCH
EVENT, FACTS OR DISPUTE.</p><p><strong>Arbitration Process</strong>. Because appearing in person for arbitration can be
unduly burdensome in the circumstances, arbitration under this Arbitration
Provision shall not require any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses
unless mutually agreed. Either or both parties may participate by written
submissions, telephone calls, or other means of remote communication as allowed
by the arbitrator. The arbitration proceedings will be conducted in the English
language at a location designated by the JAMS that is the most convenient for
you.</p><p>The arbitration can only decide Claim(s) between you and us, and may not
consolidate or join the claims of other persons that may have similar claims.
There shall be no pre-arbitration discovery except as provided for in the
applicable JAMS rules. The arbitrator will honor claims of privilege recognized
by law and will take reasonable steps to protect customer account information
and other confidential or proprietary information.</p><p>In conducting the arbitration proceeding, the arbitrator will apply the law of
the State of California (without regard to its conflicts of law provisions)
including U.S. federal law for matters covered by federal law (_e.g. _the
Federal Arbitration Act). The confidentiality provisions of this Agreement will
be enforceable under the provisions of the California Uniform Trade Secrets Act,
California Civil Code Section 3426, as amended. At the request of any party, the
arbitrator shall provide a brief written explanation of the basis for the
decision and award. Judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator may be
entered in any court having jurisdiction. The arbitrator&#39;s decision will be
final and binding on the parties except for any right to appeal under the JAMS
rules or the Federal Arbitration Act.</p><p><strong>Recovery and Attorneys&#39; Fees.</strong> If the arbitrator rules in your favor on the
merits of any Claim you bring against us and issues you an award that is greater
in monetary value than our last written settlement offer made to you before
written submissions are made to the arbitrator, then we will (i) pay you 150% of
your arbitration damages award, up to $1,000 over and above your damages award;
and (ii) pay your attorneys, if any, the amount of attorneys&#39; fees, and
reimburse any expenses (including expert witness fees and costs) that you or
your attorney reasonably incurred for investigating, preparing, and pursuing
your Claim in arbitration. The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes
as to the payment and reimbursement of such fees, expenses, and the alternative
payment and the attorney premium at any time during the proceeding and upon
request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator&#39;s ruling on the
merits. The right to attorneys&#39; fees and expenses discussed above supplements
any right to attorneys&#39; fees and expenses you may have under applicable law,
although you may not recover duplicative awards of attorneys&#39; fees or costs. If
your use of the Products was principally for personal or household use, neither
party will be entitled to any award of punitive or special damages and Pebble
waives any right it may have to seek an award of attorneys&#39; fees and expenses
from you in connection with any arbitration of Claims between us.</p><p><strong>Confidentiality.</strong> You and we shall keep confidential any information
exchanged during the arbitration as well as the decision of the arbitrator made
with respect to any Claim(s) arbitrated under this Arbitration Provision and,
with the exception of disclosure to your or our attorneys, accountants,
auditors, and other legal or financial advisors, neither party shall disclose
such information or decision to any other person unless required to do so by
law.</p><p><strong>Continuing Obligation to Arbitrate; Severability.</strong> This Arbitration Provision
shall survive termination of your access to or use of any Products and related
agreements. If any portion of this Arbitration Provision is deemed invalid or
unenforceable at law, such invalid or unenforceable provision will be
interpreted, construed or reformed to the extent required to make it valid and
enforceable, and this shall not invalidate the remaining portions of this
Arbitration Provision.</p><p><strong>Pebble Customer Service Center Address:</strong></p><p>Pebble Technology Corp.</p><p>ATTN: <strong>LEGAL/ARBITRATION</strong></p><p>900 Middlefield Road, 5th Floor </p><p>Redwood City, CA 94063</p><p>Fax Number: (650) 618-1683</p><p><strong>General</strong></p><p>If you violate these Terms, Pebble may terminate and/or suspend your right to
access the Site(s) or suspend or cancel your orders, in each case without
notice.</p><p>Pebble&#39;s failure to enforce any of these Terms is not a waiver of such term.
These Terms are the entire agreement between you and Pebble and supersede all
prior or contemporaneous negotiations, discussions or agreements between you and
Pebble about the Site(s). The proprietary rights, disclaimer of warranties,
representations made by you, indemnities, limitations of liability and general
provisions will survive any termination of these Terms.</p></div>
